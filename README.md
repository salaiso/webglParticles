# Description

This is a simplistic webgl application, which simulates a particle system and renders it on a HTML5 canvas. Depending a bit on the beefiness of your graphics card, should simulate a million particles at a smooth 60fps, all in your browser.

Uses the webgl2 context of the canvas, so you should probably use a recent version of chrome.
